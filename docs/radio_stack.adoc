=== Radio Stack Architecture (CC135x)

Nova-Link uses a custom radio stack on the TI CC135x to handle RF scheduling and data transmission.

==== Components
- Zone Scheduler: Manages rotation of active zones
- RF Core: Handles modulation, TX/RX
- SPI "Plugin"": Communicates with ESP32-S3

==== Zone Multiplexing
Only zones subscribed by the host are included in rotation, reducing power and processing overhead.

==== TX Flow
1. ESP32 sends fragment via SPI
2. CC135x buffers by zone
3. Transmits fragment in next zone window

==== RX Flow
1. CC135x receives a packet
2. Buffers and deduplicates it
3. Raises GPIO interrupt
4. ESP32 pulls the fragment over SPI
