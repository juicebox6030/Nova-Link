=== Plugin System Architecture

Nova-Link supports a modular plugin architecture on the ESP32-S3 host.

==== API Responsibilities
- Zone Managment 
- Manage plugin data fragments
- Zone 0 data management
- Zone 0 is always accessible.

==== Isolation
- Plugins are sandboxed by zoneID
- Only the latest deduplicated fragment is delivered
- Plugins cannot interfere with each other’s zone data

==== Lifecycle

1. System boot
2. Plugin init → claims zone(s)
3. Stream Tracker dispatches data
4. Plugin handles fragment
5. Optionally sends response fragment

Plugins are compiled into the firmware and run in a lightweight, event-driven fashion. INI files should be used to support "live" configuration changes.
