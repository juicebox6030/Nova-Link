== Background

Nova-Link is a modular, open wireless communication stack designed for ultra-low-latency operation in live/low-latency environments. The system targets embedded applications such as lighting, audio control, and automation —domains where reliability, timing precision, and extensibility are critical.

The architecture uses a high-level controller and plugin host (ESP32-S3), and a multi-band RF Core (TI CC1352R) as the radio core. While these rolls can be combined into one processoer, this co-processor design allows the ESP32 to focus on plugin execution, Wi-Fi/BLE, and configuration, while the CC13xx handles deterministic Sub-GHz RF communication using TI's proprietary PHY. Low-power devices may still combine these functions with know limitations.

Nova-Link avoids the limitations of traditional protocols like 802.15.4 by building on TI’s EasyLink abstraction, enabling custom DataFragment packet formats, zone-based message rotation, and burst-mode extensions. 

It enables a flexible plugin-based API that supports dynamic routing, metadata exchange, stream tracking, and eventual delivery—designed to be simple to adopt while powerful in production scenarios.

The project is released under the GPLv3 license, emphasizing open innovation while preventing proprietary lock-in.
