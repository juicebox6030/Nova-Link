=== SPI Transport Protocol

Nova-Link uses a minimal, binary SPI framing protocol for communication between the ESP32-S3 host and the TI CC1352R/1354P10 radio co-processor.

==== Topology
- ESP32-S3 is the SPI master
- CC135x is the SPI slave
- Interrupt line (GPIO) signals when data is ready

==== Host-to-Radio ("Push")
Command: 0x03  
Payload: Serialized DataFragment  
Usage: Transmit fragment to be queued and sent in RF zone window

==== Radio-to-Host ("Pull")
Command: 0x02  
Triggered when CC135x toggles INT_READY GPIO  
Returns: 0xD0 + serialized DataFragment  
Usage: Host polls for new data only when available

==== SPI Command Summary

| Command Byte | Meaning             |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 0x01         | Ping / Ready Check  |
| 0x02         | Pull Received Fragment |
| 0x03         | Push New Fragment   |
| 0x04         | Radio Status Request |
| 0xD0         | Fragment Data Type  |

==== Example Cycle
1. ESP32 sends 0x03 + fragment → CC135x buffers for TX
2. CC135x receives fragment → sets INT_READY
3. ESP32 polls with 0x02 → CC135x responds with DataFragment
