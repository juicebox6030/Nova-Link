=== Host Firmware Architecture (ESP32-S3)

The ESP32-S3 manages all plugins and SPI communication with the CC135x radio.

==== Key Responsibilities
- Plugin lifecycle and dispatch
- Plugin Fragment deduplication 
- Zone claim management
- SPI interface to radio (as plugin?)

==== Workflow
1. Boot plugins and claim zones
2. Send/receive fragments over SPI
3. Dispatch fragments to plugins via Stream Tracker
4. Collect and send plugin responses
