== Requirements

The following are the technical and product requirements for the Nova-Link system, prioritized using the MoSCoW methodology:

=== Must Have
- Support for low-latency, burst-capable wireless packet delivery over Sub-GHz
- Plugin-based API architecture with zone-based message routing and deduplication
- Deterministic zone rotation scheduler with retry/burst flags
- Packet deduplication and sequence number tracking per (originID, zoneID)
- Doxygen-based inline documentation and project-wide API docs
- GitHub project organization with reproducible folder structure and version control
- GPLv3 licensed firmware and SDK

=== Should Have
- Plugin isolation via zone claims and access control
- Plugin management layer to track active zone interest
- Support for metadata/control channel (Zone 0)
- CLI configuration interface on Host
- Live packet inspection/logging tools

=== Could Have
- Support for OTA plugin loading or dynamic plugin scaffolding
- Auto-generated plugin boilerplate (via script or GUI)
- Support for alternative host MCUs (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero, RP2040)
- Scripting sandbox for non-realtime plugin logic
- BLE control channel
- NFC control mechnism
