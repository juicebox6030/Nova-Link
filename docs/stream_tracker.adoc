=== Stream Tracker

The Stream Tracker is apart of the API and ensures deduplication and correct routing of incoming `DataFragment`s.

==== Key Features
- Tracks (originID, zoneID) → seqNum
- Deduplicates retransmitted fragments
- Delivers only the latest data to plugins
- Operates in RAM buffer (not persistent)

==== Behavior
- New fragment → check seqNum
- If new → update buffer, call plugin
- If duplicate → silently discard

This helps maintain low processing overhead and prevents stale plugin data.
